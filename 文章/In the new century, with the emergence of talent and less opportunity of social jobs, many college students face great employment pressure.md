In the new century, with the emergence of talent and less opportunity of social jobs, many college students face great employment pressure. At the same time, someone choose to do pioneering work, and some succeeded, some failed. To find a stable job or to start a business has become a hot topic.

新世纪，随着优秀人才涌现及社会就业岗位的缩减，很多大学生都面临很大的就业压力。同时，一些人选择创业，有的成功了，有的失败了。找一份稳定的工作，还是选择创业已经成为一个热点话题。

First of all, a stable job let the freshmen learn experience from predecessor faster. Lacking of the contacts and fund would be one important reason for most Chinese college students to find a stable job. At present, not only in China but all around the world are facing great employment pressure , the news of Wall Street's bankruptcy, the U.S. government closed makes people understand clearly that to find a job is not easy right now.

首先，一份稳定的工作可以让初入职场的人更快的学习前辈的经验。由于人脉和资金的缺陷，找一份稳定的工作目前是大部分中国大学生的选择。但是目前不仅是在中国，全世界都面临很大的就业压力，美国华尔街破产，美国政府关门的新闻让人更清楚，找工作 不是一件容易的事。

Secondly, to start a business let the entrepreneurs handle their times freely and win respect from others. Graduates can be their own boss and decide their business. In recent years, governments have introduced policies to encourage graduates to do pioneering work. Therefore, it is a good opportunity to try. When the business success, entrepreneurs would not only win money but respect and prestige, even make their dreams come true.

第二，创业可以让人自由支配时间及赢得尊重。毕业生可以自己成为老板，决定自己的业务。近年来，国家也出台政策鼓励高校毕业生积极创业。因此，这是一个很好的尝试机会。当创业成功时，创业者赢得的不仅仅是金钱还有尊重和威望，甚至成就了自己的梦想。

For me, I think whether one suit open a company should according to his reality situation .because it exists big risk and not everyone can withstand failure .

对我而言 ，我觉得创业要根据个人的实际情况来决定，因为创业风险很大， 不是每个人都能承受创业的失败。
