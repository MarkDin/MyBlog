**sh**ould a college graduate rent or purchase a house****

the picture below described a college graduate is standing at a cross road, one is lead to a flat, the other is a house. which road to go indecates whether he purchase a house or rent. it seems to me, 

I think rent a house is a better choice.

on the one hand, as a graduate, you can't afford to buy a house by yourself, if then, ask money from your parents will give them a lot of pressures, which is not a person more than 18 will plan to do. so if you cant' earn the money by yourself then rent a house is a better choice to meet your requirement and release your afford.

on the other hand, renting a house is more worthy than purchasing it, you don't know where you will work and live at present, so perhaps buying a house here will be a waste of money, supposing even  you have full money to buy a house, it 's beneficial to make adventage of the money to invest rather than run out of it. we are still young and have a large amount of time and a fantastic future to envisage. so dont't put yourself at a permanent place.
